You are onboard a large raft formed of 36 wooden platforms which are joined together by a set of rope bridges. 

The platforms form 6 vertical columns, 6 diagonal rows, and 6 diagonal 3 by 2 groups as indicated by the alternating vertical and horizontal wooden slats on each platform. 

Two platforms are considered to be adjacent to each other if they are connected by one of the rope bridges.

Each platform has the hints from 1 to 6 arranged in a circle, and to solve the puzzle you must eliminate hints one by one, until each platform has one value remaining according to various rules.

Each platform is also of one of 3 types: detective, worker, or imposter. Aboard the raft with you are 18 imposters, 12 workers and 6 detectives each occupying their own platform.

The type of a platform is inferred by the location of its value hint in the circle of 6 hints:  if the platform value is one of the bottom three hints (indicated with small "buttons" to the bottom left of the hint), the platform has an imposter on it; if the platform value is the one top hint (indicated by a small "button" to the top left of the hint), the platform has a detective on it, otherwise the platform has a worker on it (worker hints have no "buttons" next to the hint). 

The following limitations apply to all platforms:
- each row, column and 3 by 2 group contain each value 1 to 6 once
- detectives are never on platforms adjacent to each other
- all the workers attempt to stay together and are on platforms that form a set of 12 adjacent platforms (i.e. it is always possible to go from one worker to another by traversing the rope bridges and only passing through other worker platforms)
- conversely imposters attempt to hide away from each other and do not form a continuous group of adjacent platforms 
- detectives are on the raft to hunt out the imposters, and the numerical value of a detective platform indicates the number of impostors that are adjacent to that platform
- imposters spy on adjacent platforms, where a platform is an imposter, the other 2 imposter hints (not including the value of the cell) are the values of one of the adjacent platforms

## Tutorial

1. You are aboard a raft formed of 36 platforms arranged in a 6 by 6 grid and joined together by ropes bridges.

1. Your cruise liner met with difficulties on the high seas and you were forced to abandon ship...
2. You are onboard one of 36 life raft joined together by rope bridges whilst you float on the ocean current towards an empty horizon.
3. Onboard the life rafts with you are numerous other passengers and 36 people all of whom claim to be crew members.
4. To maintain order, the crew members have spread themselves out across the rafts such that each individual life raft has exactly one crew member.
5. Unfortunately is seems that there are imposters among the crew as they are all complaining that some of them are not real crew. The imposters want to take control of the raft and its resources for themselves.
6. In the commotion, it seems that only off-duty crew ended up onboard your group of life rafts. They are all wearing civilian clothes, and nobody can distinguish them from other passengers.
7. Since the crew cannot decide by majority amongst themselves who are the imposters, the other passengers have chosen you to try and deduce who the imposters are before it is too late.
8. Unbeknownst to you, it appears that somebody onboard the raft knows the identity of all of the crew members and imposters. They have quietly slipped a piece of paper into your pocket containing information which might help you save the raft.
9. You find the piece of paper and unfold it, finding a diagram of all the rafts arranged in a 6 by 6 grid with the numbers 1-6 arranged around the center of each raft in different orders. It appears that this person would rather watch you solve a puzzle than save the raft themselves.
10. You ask around amongst the passengers, but nobody admits to making the note, and in the absence of any other information to go on, you are forced to read the instructions in order to try and solve the puzzle.
11. The informant says that: 
    1.  There are a total of 18 crew and 18 imposters on board the raft
    2.  6 of the crew know exactly how many imposters are adjacent to them, and their value corresponds
    3.  The remaining 12 crew only recognise each other, and have positioned themselves to be adjacent
    4.  The 18 imposters have spread out such that they are not adjacent
    5.  Each imposter "reports" on adjacent rafts
