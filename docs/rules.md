You are onboard a large raft formed of 36 wooden platforms which are joined together by a set of rope bridges. 

The platforms form 6 vertical columns, 6 diagonal rows, and 6 diagonal 3 by 2 groups as indicated by the alternating vertical and horizontal wooden slats on each platform. 

Two platforms are considered to be adjacent to each other if they are connected by one of the rope bridges.

Each platform has the hints from 1 to 6 arranged in a circle, and to solve the puzzle you must eliminate hints one by one, until each platform has one value remaining according to various rules.

Each platform is also of one of 3 types: detective, worker, or imposter. Aboard the raft with you are 18 imposters, 12 workers and 6 detectives each occupying their own platform.

The type of a platform is inferred by the location of its value hint in the circle of 6 hints:  if the platform value is one of the bottom three hints (indicated with small "buttons" to the bottom left of the hint), the platform has an imposter on it; if the platform value is the one top hint (indicated by a small "button" to the top left of the hint), the platform has a detective on it, otherwise the platform has a worker on it (worker hints have no "buttons" next to the hint). 

The following limitations apply to all platforms:
- each row, column and 3 by 2 group contain each value 1 to 6 once
- detectives are never on platforms adjacent to each other
- all the workers attempt to stay together and are on platforms that form a set of 12 adjacent platforms (i.e. it is always possible to go from one worker to another by traversing the rope bridges and only passing through other worker platforms)
- conversely imposters attempt to hide away from each other and do not form a continuous group of adjacent platforms 
- detectives are on the raft to hunt out the imposters, and the numerical value of a detective platform indicates the number of impostors that are adjacent to that platform
- imposters spy on adjacent platforms, where a platform is an imposter, the other 2 imposter hints (not including the value of the cell) are the values of one of the adjacent platforms
