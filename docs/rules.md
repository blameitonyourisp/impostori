You are onboard a large raft formed of 36 wooden platforms which are joined together by a set of rope bridges. 

The platforms form 6 vertical columns, 6 diagonal rows, and 6 diagonal 3 by 2 groups as indicated by the alternating vertical and horizontal wooden slats on each platform. 

Two platforms are considered to be adjacent to each other if they are connected by one of the rope bridges.

Each platform has the hints from 1 to 6 arranged in a circle, and to solve the puzzle you must eliminate hints one by one, until each platform has one value remaining according to various rules.

Each platform is also of one of 3 types: detective, worker, or imposter. Aboard the raft with you are 18 imposters, 12 workers and 6 detectives each occupying their own platform.

The type of a platform is inferred by the location of its value hint in the circle of 6 hints:  if the platform value is one of the bottom three hints (indicated with small "buttons" to the bottom left of the hint), the platform has an imposter on it; if the platform value is the one top hint (indicated by a small "button" to the top left of the hint), the platform has a detective on it, otherwise the platform has a worker on it (worker hints have no "buttons" next to the hint). 

The following limitations apply to all platforms:
- each row, column and 3 by 2 group contain each value 1 to 6 once
- detectives are never on platforms adjacent to each other
- all the workers attempt to stay together and are on platforms that form a set of 12 adjacent platforms (i.e. it is always possible to go from one worker to another by traversing the rope bridges and only passing through other worker platforms)
- conversely imposters attempt to hide away from each other and do not form a continuous group of adjacent platforms 
- detectives are on the raft to hunt out the imposters, and the numerical value of a detective platform indicates the number of impostors that are adjacent to that platform
- imposters spy on adjacent platforms, where a platform is an imposter, the other 2 imposter hints (not including the value of the cell) are the values of one of the adjacent platforms

## Tutorial

1. Whilst relaxing during a well-earned break, your cruise liner begins sinking on the high seas and you are forced to abandon ship...
2. You find yourself onboard one of 36 life rafts, haphazardly joined together by rope bridges, floating on the ocean current towards an empty horizon.
3. Onboard the life rafts with you are numerous other passengers along with 36 people who all claim to be crew members.
4. To maintain order, the crew members have spread themselves out across the rafts such that each individual life raft has exactly one crew member.
5. Unfortunately it seems that some of the crew are imposters...
6. In the commotion of the evacuation, only off-duty crew have ended up onboard your life rafts. They are all wearing civilian clothes, and nobody can distinguish them either from the other passengers or from the imposters.
7. The imposters want to take control of the life rafts and its resources for themselves. Since the crew cannot decide amongst themselves who the imposters are, the other passengers have chosen you to try and work it out. Can you deduce who they are before it is too late?
8. Unbeknownst to you, somebody onboard knows the identity of all of the crew members and imposters. They have quietly slipped a piece of paper into your pocket containing information which might help you save the life rafts and everyone onboard.
9.  You find the piece of paper and unfold it, finding a diagram of all of the life rafts arranged in a 6 by 6 grid with the numbers 1-6 arranged around the center of each raft in different orders. 
10. It appears that the mystery informant would rather watch you solve a puzzle than save the raft themselves.
11. You ask around amongst the passengers, but nobody admits to making the note, and in the absence of any other information to go on, you are forced to read the instructions in order to try and solve the puzzle and identify the imposters...
12. Instructions:
    1. You must eliminate numbers from each raft until only one number remains. This number will be that raft's value.
    2. Each row must contain raft values from 1 to 6 once and only once.
    3. Each column must contain raft values from 1 to 6 once and only once.
    4. Each 3 by 2 box must contain raft values from 1 to 6 once and only once.
    5. The currently selected raft will be displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen, and the common row, column and box will be highlighted in the grid.
    6. Rafts whose values are in the bottom half of the raft have an imposter onboard. There are 18 such "imposter" rafts in total.
    7. Rafts whose values are in the top half of the raft have a real crew member onboard. There are also 18 of such "crew" rafts in total.
    8. Rafts are considered to be adjacent if and only if they are joined by a rope bridge.
    9. 6 of the crew know exactly how many imposters are on adjacent rafts to themselves. Such rafts have their raft value at the very top of the raft, and the raft value indicates how many adjacent imposter rafts there are. These rafts are called "detective" rafts.
    10. The remaining 12 crew members recognise some of the other crew, and have formed a group of continuously adjacent rafts called "worker" rafts (i.e. it is possible to move from one worker raft to any other by only passing through other worker rafts)
    11. The 18 imposters have spread out, and do not form a continuously adjacent group in an effort to not be discovered (i.e. it is not possible to pass from one imposter raft to all others by passing through only other imposter rafts).
    12. Each imposter raft spies on its adjacent rafts (whether they are fellow imposters or crew). The other 2 numbers in the bottom half of the raft (excluding the imposter raft value) will be included amongst the raft values of the adjacent rafts.
